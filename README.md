<h4>Usage</h4>
<hr/>
The default shortcut assigned to smart-search is Ctrl-K (Windows, Linux).

It will identify the programming language in use and request filtered results accordingly.
A non filtered search over all documentation entries can be invoked by adding the Alt modifier key to the shortcut.
